# Operating-Systems-1-Project-Tasks

These are the project tasks written in C for the 3rd Semester "Operating Systems 1" Class in the Computer Science B.Sc. program at Politechnika Warszawa.

Makefile of each task is included with the source codes. Requirements to be satisfied when implementing the solution are also included.

Project D  is a multi-threaded file indexer that recursively scans the current directory, stores certain properties of directory, such as how many image files there 
are, in a data structure and has several functionalities the user can execute. 

Project A was an extra credit task I requested. It's a zero-player multi-threaded implementation of the well-known Snake game. I'm very satisfied with the result
especially how I handled wayfinding for the snakes. Watching the snakes race towards their targeted food tiles was lots of fun.
